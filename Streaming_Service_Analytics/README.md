# Music Streaming Platform – Cohort Analysis

This repository presents a **cohort analysis** of users on a music streaming platform, focusing on user retention, engagement, and listening behavior. The goal of this analysis is to understand how users interact with the platform over time, identify trends in activity, and provide insights for improving user engagement.

## Key Focus Areas
- **Activity Trends:** Average user activity and song plays per day.  
- **User Retention:** Percentage of users returning to the platform over time.  
- **Platform Comparison:** Differences in engagement and conversion between iOS and Android users.  
- **Weekend vs Weekday Behavior:** How user behavior changes on weekends compared to weekdays.  
- **Funnel Analysis:** How users progress from onboarding to playing their first song and where drop-offs occur.

## Dashboard Charts

### 1. User Activity Over Time (Play song vs. Any active event daily)
![User Activity Over Time](Daily_activity.png) 
This chart shows that since the launch of the service, the number of users performing an active action or listening to a song increased throughout June 2023, as interest in the new app grew. On Saturdays and Sundays, the number of active events and song plays generally decreases noticeably. Therefore, it makes sense to take actions to increase user activity on weekends. We also understand that most users who visited the platform were listening to songs.

### 2. Average User Activity
![Average User Activity](Activity_average_per_user.png)  
This chart demonstrates a stable trend in the average number of song plays and other active events per user. On weekends, the number of users decreases less compared to the number of active actions. In other words, users still visit the platform but show less interest in it on weekends. However, the stable trend in the number of song plays throughout the month indicates that on weekends people may not have the time or desire to search for something new, instead listening to either what the platform recommends or what they had previously selected.

### 3. Daily Retention Rate
